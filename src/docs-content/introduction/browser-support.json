In fact, Firefox has native support behind a flag, indicating full native support is near.</p>\n<p>For browsers without native support, a small polyfill helps developers use Custom Elements seamlessly and with little performance overhead.</p>\n<p>Stencil uses a dynamic loader to load the custom elements polyfill only on browsers that need it. With this polyfill Stencil&#39;s browser support is Chrome (and all chrome based browsers), Safari, Firefox, Edge, and IE11.</p>\n<p>Web Components are being used in production today with the above approach.</p>\n<stencil-route-link url=\"/docs/goals-and-objectives\" router=\"#router\" custom=\"true\">\n  <button class=\"pull-left btn btn--secondary\">\n    Back\n  </button>\n</stencil-route-link>\n\n<stencil-route-link url=\"/docs/getting-started\" router=\"#router\" custom=\"true\">\n  <button class=\"pull-right btn btn--primary\">\n    Next\n  </button>\n</stencil-route-link>\n"}
