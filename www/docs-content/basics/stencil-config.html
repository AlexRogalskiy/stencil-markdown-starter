<h1 id="stencil-config">Stencil Config</h1>
<p>The <code>stencil.config.js</code> file is where all Stencil configuration happens.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example configuration:</p>
<pre><code>exports.config = {
  publicPath: <span class="hljs-string">'/build'</span>,
  bundles: [
    { components: [<span class="hljs-symbol">'stencil</span>-site', <span class="hljs-symbol">'site</span>-header', <span class="hljs-symbol">'landing</span>-page'] },
    { components: [<span class="hljs-symbol">'app</span>-marked', <span class="hljs-symbol">'getting</span>-started', <span class="hljs-symbol">'basics</span>-components', <span class="hljs-symbol">'compiler</span>-config', <span class="hljs-symbol">'what</span>-is', <span class="hljs-symbol">'code</span>-splitting', <span class="hljs-symbol">'stencil</span>-ssr', <span class="hljs-symbol">'site</span>-menu'] },
    { components: [<span class="hljs-symbol">'demos</span>-page'] }
  ],
  collections: [
    { name: <span class="hljs-string">'@stencil/router'</span>}
  ]
};
</code></pre><p>The <code>publicPath</code> field should start with a <code>/</code> and be the directory that you intend to use for deployment. By default, it will be set to <code>/build</code> which will work in most cases.</p>
<p><code>bundles</code> is an array of objects that represent how components are grouped together in lazy-loaded bundles. It is important to note that every Stencil component be included in a bundle. In the example above, each object in the <code>bundles</code> array has its own <code>components</code> array, which is the HTML tag name for each component. In general, the simplest approach is to give each component its own bundle. A more advanced optimization would be grouping commonly used components together.</p>
<p><code>collections</code> is a field to specify a list of 3rd party Stencil libraries. Since everything in Stencil is async and lazy loaded by default, it is important to NOT have any hard <code>import</code> statements linking components together. Any library listed in the list <code>collections</code> entry will be recognized and included in the application by the Stencil compiler. By default, the <code>@Stencil/router</code> will be included.</p>
